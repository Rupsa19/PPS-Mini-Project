A Phone Book Management System in C is a console application without graphics. This simple mini project in C creates an external file to store the user's data permanently to perform file handling operations. File handling and data structure concepts has been extensively used for almost all functions in this mini project. Adding new records, listing them, search for contacts saved, and modify them and updating, and deleting the phonebook record are the basic function which make up the main menu of this phonebook. Personal information such as name, phone number, address, father’s name, mother’s name, gender, email are asked while adding a record into the phonebook. These records can then be listed, searched, modified for and removing. Many functions have been used in this project. These functions are easy to understand as their name only signifies their respective operations.
